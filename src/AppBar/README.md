# AppBar
The `AppBar` desktop component can be build with the `AppBarTab` and `AppBarTabs` components rather than 
  the material versions of `Tab` and `Tabs` in order to achieve this look for the tabs where the height
   extends all to 100% height of the container appbar, as well as having a hover color and a thicker bottom
   indicator for selected tabs.  
   
   The mobile version can be build with an `AppBarMenuDrawer` that will hold the tabs visible in desktop as
   menu items in order to save horizontal space (click on the left hamburger menu to see it in action)
