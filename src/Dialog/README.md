# Dialog
This component exposes an `onClose` prop that if passed will render a close (X) icon on the top right, which 
is a common behaviour of most dialogs and is missing from material's implementation. Another thing this component
can do for you is to layout the action buttons (if `DialogActions` is used to compose the content) for mobile. 
i.e. it will place ech button inside the actions on top of the other and they will take the whole width of the dialog.
shrink the screen size while dialog is open in this story to see an example.
