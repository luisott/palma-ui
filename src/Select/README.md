# Select
A `Select` component with predefined styles to show up outside of the trigger unlike in material
which displays right on top with the selection on the trigger. 
Using this menu will also take the border radius from the one set in the theme under `theme.shape.borderRadius` 
rather than defaulting to 4px always.
This `Select` matches the style of other menus in Palma UI
