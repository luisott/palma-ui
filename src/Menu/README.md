# Menu
Wraps Material's `Menu` to ensure consistency with the other menus in Palma UI. Using this menu
will also take the border radius from the one set in the theme under `theme.shape.borderRadius`
rather than defaulting to 4px always.
You can choose to open the menu up, down and pick which horizontal alignment to use.T.
